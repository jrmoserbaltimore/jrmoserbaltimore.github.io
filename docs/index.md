# Portfolio Page for John Moser

I am a professional with experience in IT security, Linux system administration, and hardware descriptor languages, currently working on a bachelor's degree at UMBC for computer engineering.  I am interested in digital signal processing and chip or FPGA logic design.

I also hold a degree in Public Policy and International Affairs from University of Baltimore, and have significant experience communicating complex concepts to people without the background knowledge to readily understand them.

## Portfolio

* [Microcontroller source code for UROS class project](https://github.com/jrmoserbaltimore/uros2023-firmware), written in RobotC for a Vex Cortex module.  Implements tank controls with mode locking in moving (forward, backward), turning, and precision mode (each stick controls individual treads).  Code is relatively simple, and commented clearly.  Robot built by a team of four engineering students:  one computer engineer, three mechanical engineers.

## Skills and Competencies

* **Programming Languages**:  Python, MicroPyhton, C#, bash, Verilog, Amaranth HDL, SQL
* **Technical Skills**:  Data analysis, information security, Linux systems administration
* **Soft Skills**:  Research, requirements gathering, conflict resolution, communication of technical concepts to people outside the given technical discipline
* **Developer Tools**:  Visual Studio, Thonny, Vivado, JupyterLab, Latex, Pandas, MATLAB
* **Frameworks**:  ISO 27001, NIST 80-171, Octave Allegro
* **Areas of Interest**:  Microcontroller programming, signal processing, data analysis, HDL

## Non-Competencies

* **Applications Programming, Web Programming**:  The skills to program with data analysis and reporting tools, small automation projects, microcontrollers, or hardware descriptor languages don't translate to engineering large applications; I am reasonably skilled at the former, but not in any way competent for the latter.

## Education

* **University of Maryland, Baltimore County College of Engineering and Information Technology**
  
  *Pursuing BS, Computer Engineering; additionally following Compsci game development track*

  *Expected 2027*
* **University of Baltimore College of Public Affairs**
  
  *B.A, Public Policy and International Affairs*
  
  *Graduated 2022, GPA 3.9*
